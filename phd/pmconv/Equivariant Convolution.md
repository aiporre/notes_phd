> Theory of the book of equivariant convolution

## Introduction
this solves the problem of having a feature extraction functionn
$$
f: X(M, C) \rightarrow X(M, C')
$$
such that cosidering a group $G = \{g\}$ are linear operators obeying a group properties, that means closure, associativity, negative and inverse (CANI).

$f$ is equivariant if 
$$
g.(f(X)) = f(g.X).
$$
One need to complete this with representation theory and generative group etc 

## State of art

We have:
1. [[spherical cnn]]
2. [[pm conv]]
3.
