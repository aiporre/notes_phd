## compact groups
#compact_groups
A topological space with a group stucture, that is binary operator (product) given by $\odot: X \times X \rightarrow X$ that is C.A.N.I. . In addition the inverse and product i$(x,y) \rightarrow xy$ and inverse $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ is continuos.


> **Note** A topological space has a simple structure is a set of sets of x, namely a   $tuple $(X, \tau)$  It has three conditions i) $X$ and $\varnothing$ are elements of the topology, ii) the intersection of element of the topology are in the topology, iii) the same but for union. A example is the power set of $X$ .

The concept of compactness is from topology
