Dmaj7              Bsus2                         
Heat in my bones
Dmaj7              Bsus2
there is a dead animal on the road
Dmaj7              Bsus2
I wish i could see ..........(the sun)
A6/11                B7sus2 
hear the stars sing
A6/11                B7sus2
Drizzle of butane tears
A6/11                B7sus2
Is there something I can do?
GbMaj7           Dmaj7
and I licked the last drop
Dmaj7              Bsus2                         
There is icecle somewhere
A6/11                B7sus2
and I touched last flower
A6/11                B7sus2
she cried and shut off

GbMaj7           Dmaj7
who broke the earth
GbMaj7           F#sus2
who drilled the hole
A6/11                B7sus2
If only you had stop
E6
If only you had seen
GbMaj7            A6/11                
ice is only buckets of rain

Splashing diamods liquefied, There was life It was a dream
Dmaj7                                            Bsus2
And I had a vision and it was you, I heard the echo of my footsteps
Dmaj7                                         Bsus2
I saw the blood and decended, Are you digesting my soul?
A6/11                              B7sus2 
Did you see me on TV?
A6/11                                      B7sus2 
The dream saw me running free
A6/11                             B7sus2 
The sun forsake us all
A6/11                                B7sus2 
And I accepted my fate

GbMaj7                               Dmaj7
My soul is jaded and whines , I will lay on that rock now
GbMaj7                               Dmaj7
Now you can us my skin
GbMaj7                                        Dmaj7
Here all the hearths had stopped
B7sus2                               E6
and there is hole in the sky
