Karel received a call to meet Jack at a café. Jack was one of his only close friends. That afternoon, the temperature was a chilly 10 degrees, with cold gusts cutting through Karel’s coat as he hurried to the meeting. He was running late. As he rushed onto the tram, his arm got caught in the closing doors, knocking his wristwatch loose.

"Dammit! Not now!" Karel muttered under his breath as the tram doors bounced open again. A strange-looking man picked up the watch and handed it back to him, gripping Karel's arm firmly as he did so. They locked eyes for a moment longer than felt normal. What should have been an awkward encounter felt oddly natural, as if Karel knew this man from somewhere. It was the same eerie feeling as a déjà vu. The strange character merge in the crowd, as Karel put his watch back. 

 Karel made it to the café at the agreed time. Jack, usually outgoing and full of energy, seemed tense and uneasy today. "Hey man, how’s it going?" Karel asked, but Jack didn’t respond, only giving him a strange look.

Karel ordered a black coffee and added a splash of milk, watching it swirl into the dark liquid, blending into a muted gray. Something about Jack's demeanor was off. "So, how’ve you been?" Karel asked again.

"Nothing new," Jack muttered, his voice low.

They sat in silence for several minutes. The air between them grew heavy, and Karel started to feel uncomfortable. He leaned forward and asked, "What did you want to tell me?"

Jack hesitated, then clenched his jaw. "I can't tell you now," he finally said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I just needed to clear my head... and I need your help with that. Can you do it?"

"Sure," Karel said, though something lingered on the edge of his mind. He wanted to mention the strange encounter he'd had with the man and the watch but hesitated. Instead, he asked, "How are your parents? I haven't seen them in a while."

Karel and Jack had known each other since they could remember. They went to the same school, grew up together, and Jack's parents had always treated Karel like family. He recalled the nights he'd spent at Jack's house—after parties or when he just needed to get away from his own home.

"They're... well, they're not here right now," Jack replied, his voice quieter than usual.

"What do you mean? Did they go on holiday? It's about time they took a break," Karel joked, trying to lighten the mood.

Jack's expression darkened. "No, there's something I need to tell you. But first..." He paused, as if gathering his thoughts. "Can we just talk, like normal? Like we used to. I can't even remember the last time we spent time together. How about we take a walk by the lake?". 

They jumped into the car, and Jack hit the gas, driving faster and faster. Karel shifted uncomfortably in his seat. "Take it easy, man," he said, glancing nervously at Jack, whose eyes were reddened, brimming with unshed tears.

Jack's voice trembled as he started talking about his parents—their constant arguments, how they never understood him. Karel’s mind raced, sensing something deeper, something worse. He could see the tension in Jack’s tight grip on the steering wheel, the way his jaw clenched. Karel hesitated, unsure whether to keep pushing or pull back.

"Maybe we should stop, take a break," Karel suggested, trying to calm the growing sense of unease. But Jack barely registered his words, too caught up in venting about his parents. He ranted about how they forced him to study, how they never listened, how he always felt like a burden.

Karel's concern deepened. Jack was clearly in no state to drive. "Let’s stop at the next gas station," Karel urged, "We can switch places, talk things through more calmly."

Just as he finished speaking, a loud thumping sound interrupted them. One of the wheels had gone flat. The car lurched to the side of the road, and Jack pulled over, his hands shaking.

"Calm down, man," Karel said softly, trying to reassure him. "Everything’s gonna be okay."

Jack wiped his eyes, sniffling. "Thanks, Karel. You’re always there for me."

Karel stepped out of the car, stretching his legs, but something strange caught his attention. His watch had stopped—frozen at exactly 6:12. He frowned, then turned back to the car. Jack had locked the doors and was staring blankly ahead, tears streaming down his face.

"Jack, open the door," Karel said, knocking on the driver’s side window. But Jack didn’t respond, lost in his own world.

"Stay here," Karel called out, trying to keep his voice steady. "I’ll go get help."

He headed down the road, following the bicycle path along the side street. After walking for what felt like twenty minutes, he reached for his phone to check directions to the nearest gas station—only to realize he had left it in the car.

> Idea 1: light from distant come to Karel. the air was dry and cold. Somehow the stars look weird and merged with the tree line, the like approached fast feeling like it creating a vacuum. He cannot conceptualize what had just happened, but suddenly we was sitting in the train as nothing of had happened a bad dream. He wakes up in a empty train wagon.

A strange light flickered in the distance, growing brighter as it moved toward Karel. The night air was dry and bitterly cold, biting at his skin. He glanced up at the sky, but something felt off. The stars—usually clear and distinct—looked blurred, as though they had merged with the dark silhouette of the trees at the horizon. The light drew closer, unnaturally fast, and with it came a strange sensation, as if the very air around him was being pulled away, creating a vacuum.

Karel's heart pounded in his chest. He tried to move, but his legs felt heavy, almost frozen in place. The light was upon him now, a blinding force that overwhelmed his senses. He couldn’t comprehend what was happening. His thoughts raced, but before he could fully grasp the situation, everything shifted.

Suddenly, he was sitting on a train.

The world around him had changed in an instant. The eerie light, the cold, the strange sky—gone. He blinked, disoriented, his mind struggling to catch up. The steady clatter of the train’s wheels on the tracks filled his ears, a dull, repetitive sound. His breathing steadied, though confusion still clouded his thoughts. Had it been a dream? A hallucination?

He glanced around the train car. It was empty. Rows of seats stretched out in front of him, bathed in dim, flickering light. Outside the window, darkness pressed in, no stars, no trees—just an endless void.

Karel rubbed his eyes and tried to shake off the lingering unease. But something felt wrong. He couldn’t remember how he’d gotten here, or where the train was heading. His heart still beat rapidly in his chest, as if the strange light were still with him, somewhere just beyond the edge of his perception.

The train rattled on through the night, and Karel sat in silence, unsure whether he had truly left the dream behind—or if he had just entered another. His watch was showing 4:12 pm. He was late for his meeting and somehow in the other side of the city.

>Meets the extrange mann end of the train. Follows him. The man step out in the ubahn stop. Jumps out and start walking fast. The man run across the people like a gost, we agilely and fast run across the crowd. Karel run but lost him. He continue running along the hall. He saw the muddy coat sliping acrosss the corner in to the alley. He runs in the allew looking for him. He seem to had disappeaded. His reek was the only cue that he let to his location. Karel follow the smell. the man had disappeared succesfully. he could not help him self to feel like the man was part of his life. The noise of leaf on the background brought the smell again with the wind the same cold gust from before, bring the stiky smell. Karel run to the to the end of the alley to an open forest. The instict say to him that man was in the forst. Karen continued into the forest. The trees shape shadows and casted brown and red shapes of autum vibes. THe trees seem to bend again. Karel got really scared and yelled " is there anyone here?" The idea of going coming back to the train and go home crossed his mind, but somehow an urge of finding this man was calling to him. Suddenly, on the distance saw a dark shadow vanishing. Karel run and feel the cold air of rushing blood on his thorugh leaving a metallic feeling on his nose. The space once more stareted to bend, his bones starting to feel cold again. Bending the distances, the time started to get configusing. Birds and animals seem to make more noise and crawling trying to scape from the bending of space. Karel was staring to feel like the darkness covered him, he could not see even his legs. The light on the treen on the distance froze and the felt like he could see his own back. Karel thought that he was complete crazy or sleeping, "wake up wake up" he screem out loud. "what do you want! please! come and help me! I know you! Please", the noise suddenly stopped and a completly silence and all the light as suddenly vanished into one point. The man was there infront of Karel. Karel asked super ancious "what is happeing?", the man answerd, "you know, i know you are very intellint." The man took something from the dark floor, which strengly took to the form of white pebble. The man started drawing on the floor making sparks. He said, you have a mission. you need to solve the puzzle by you own for my own good, cross the doors before it closes and make the cycle complete. "what do you mean?" said Karel complete confused. The man seem to had disappead, but now karel was in another position on the twisted space infront a set on undecipherable letter and symbols, he recognized some symbols of the minkowsky space and metric space. "Close the space, hurry! Time is limitless but not always this is not the case, you have to solve the equiation" yelled the man. Suddenly, karel woke up facing down the sand, he fellt like the fishy smell and salty air into his lung. The light was painful and the image of a beach started forming. He woke up completly soaked. Karel felt complete in panic, and though the almost drowned.   


Karel spotted the strange man at the end of the train and, without thinking, followed him. The man stepped off at the next U-Bahn stop and quickly disappeared into the crowd. Karel hurried after him, weaving through people, but the man moved like a ghost—agile, swift, almost unreal. Despite his efforts, Karel lost sight of him. He scanned the hall and caught a glimpse of a muddy coat slipping around a corner into a narrow alley.

He sprinted down the alley, searching desperately, but the man seemed to have vanished. All that remained was the man's unmistakable reek, a lingering scent that guided Karel further. Driven by instinct, Karel continued his pursuit, but the man had successfully disappeared. Strangely, Karel couldn’t shake the feeling that this man was somehow tied to his life, a missing piece of his own story.

A sudden gust of cold wind rustled the leaves, bringing the same sticky, foul smell back to him. Karel followed it, running to the alley's end, where an open forest awaited. His gut told him the man had fled into the woods, so he followed. The autumn trees bent and twisted in eerie shapes, casting long, red-brown shadows. A sense of dread washed over him, and Karel, frightened, yelled into the stillness, "Is anyone here?"

For a moment, he considered turning back, retreating to the safety of the train and going home. But something inside urged him forward—an inexplicable pull toward the man. Then, in the distance, Karel saw a dark figure vanish into the trees. He ran harder, the cold air cutting into his throat, leaving a metallic taste in his mouth. His surroundings began to distort—the trees seemed to stretch and bend, and the very distance ahead warped. Time itself felt slippery, confusing. Birds squawked and animals rustled as if they were trying to escape from the distorted space.

The darkness around Karel thickened until he couldn’t even see his own legs. The light in the trees ahead froze, and for a bizarre moment, Karel thought he could see his own back. He felt trapped in some impossible reality, unsure whether he was awake or dreaming. “Wake up! Wake up!” he screamed. “What do you want from me? Please, I know you! Help me!”

Suddenly, everything went silent. The light collapsed into a single point, and the man reappeared before him. Karel, panicked and anxious, blurted out, “What’s happening?”

The man, eerily calm, replied, “You already know. You’re smarter than you think.” He bent down, picking something up from the ground—a white pebble, though the dark floor twisted oddly beneath it. He started drawing strange symbols with the pebble, and sparks flew from the lines. "You have a mission. You must solve the puzzle yourself, for your sake and mine. Cross the door before it closes. Complete the cycle."

Karel, utterly confused, asked, “What do you mean?”

But the man was already gone, and Karel found himself standing in a warped space in front of a set of undecipherable symbols and letters. Some were familiar—he recognized traces of Minkowski space and metric equations. "Close the space!" the man’s voice echoed in the distance. "Time is limitless, but not for long. Solve the equation!"

Then, everything went black.

Karel jolted awake, his face pressed against gritty sand, gasping for air. He felt salt in his lungs, the fishy stench of the sea filling his senses. Blinding light seared his eyes, and as the image of a beach came into focus, he realized he was soaked. Panic set in—he must have almost drowned. Disoriented and shaking, Karel tried to piece together what had just happened, unsure if it was real or just some twisted nightmare.
